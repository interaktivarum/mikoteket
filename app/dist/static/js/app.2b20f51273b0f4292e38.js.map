För att lyckas med detta måste motorn först förstå vad du faktiskt söker efter, ett komplext problem som består av flera steg.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\tInledningsvis analyseras språk och grammatik. Detta innefattar bland annat att korrigera felstavningar, <a href=\"https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemmer\" title=\"Wikipedia: Stemmer\" target=\"_blank\">trunkering</a>, hitta relevanta synonymer samt att identifiera <a href=\"https://sv.wiktionary.org/wiki/nyckelord\" title=\"Wiktionary: Nyckelord\" target=\"_blank\">nyckelord</a> och -termer.

I resultatet så prioriteras sidor som är skrivna på ditt valda språk, och utifrån hundratals andra webbplats-specifika parametrar såsom sidans ålder, <a href=\"https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anv%C3%A4ndbarhet\" title=\"Wikipedia: Användbarhet\" target=\"_blank\">användbarhet</a> och hur många andra webbsidor som länkar till webbplatsen.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\tNu har sökmotorn gjort ett första urval av relevanta sidor för din sökning, och det är dags att göra resultatet personligt anpassat. Även här spelar en mängd faktorer roll, inte minst din geografiska position - något som du säkert noterade i sökresultaten ovan då du föreslogs lokala fiskrestauranger. Att avgöra din geografiska position är förhållandevis enkelt, förutsatt att hårdvaran stödjer det och att du först tillåter webbplatsen att läsa dina koordinater.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<location-component></location-component>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t Många sökmotorer sparar även information om dina surfvanor för att ytterligare skräddarsy sökresultaten. Ifall du är idrotts- eller modeintresse så speglas detta sannolikt i dina sökningar och i de webbplatser du besöker. Detta noteras och registreras av sökmotorerna som hittar mönster och skapar sig en förståelse för vem du är. När du vid senare tillfälle söker på en geografisk ort, e.g. Göteborg, så kan denna information användas för att, exempelvis, ge personligt riktad information om idrottsevenemang eller klädbutiker på denna ort.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t De resultat som <i>du</i> ser vid en sökning kan skilja sig avsevärt från en annan persons resultat, trots att ni har sökt på exakt samma term.

Bland de trogna läsarna är misstron mot <a-wiki c=\"Mainstream_media\">etablerad media</a-wiki> ofta stor, medan man anser att alternativmedia vågar \"berätta sanningen\" eller \"den ocensurerade verkligheten\". I själva verket delges ofta en tydligt onyanserad bild i syfte att svartmåla ett perspektiv, och skönmåla alternativet.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Ett relaterat begrepp är <a-wiki c=\"Framing_(social_sciences)\" lang=\"en\">framing</a-wiki>, eller inramning.

Ett objekt kan vara exempelvis en kratta, en tekanna, en knapp eller en webbplats. Den övergripande designen består ofta av många olika designelement, exempelvis består en webbplats av textavsnitt, bilder, länkar och knappar, m.m. vilka presenteras i en särskild <a-wiki c=\"Layout\">layout</a-wiki>.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Det är vanligt att skilja på <a-wiki c=\"Grafisk_formgivning\">grafisk design</a-wiki> och <a-wiki c=\"Interaktionsdesign\">interaktionsdesign</a-wiki>.

Vice versa ska objektet vara designat så att den avsedda och förväntade funktionaliteten möjliggörs.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n     Vidare bör all design utgå från den tänkta användaren och dennes behov. Hänsyn ska tas till användarens förkunskaper, förutsättningar och begränsingar, den tid och situation då objektet är tänkt att användas, samt övrigt som påverkar hur objektet eller användandet av detsamma upplevs av den tilltänkte användaren.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Många av våra vardagliga föremål har en väl genomarbetad design som vi ofta tar för given och inte funderar särskilt mycket kring. För att synliggöra designen i vardagsföremål skapar konstnären Katerina Kamprani i projektet <a href=\"https://www.theuncomfortable.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Uncomfortable</a> objekt i vilka den obekväma designen motverkar, snarare än stödjer, den funktionalitet användaren förväntar sig eller är van vid.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Bra design ska vara tillgänglig för alla. Även om våra vardagliga föremål ofta har en genomtänkt design kan de i många fall vara svåra eller rentav farliga att använda för personer med olika funktionsnedsättningar. I videon nedan presenteras en designer i Singapore som, efter att ha noterat sår och ärr på många blinda personers händer och armar till följd av matlagning med köksverktyg utformade för seende personer, började omdesigna vanliga föremål i köket.\n  </p>\n\n  <media-container class=\"mediaContainer\">\n    <div>\n      <div class=\"content\">\n        <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https://www.facebook.com/cnainsider/videos/463816680781163/\" width=\"500\" height=\"422\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"caption\">\n        Många köksverktyg är svåra eller farliga att använda för blinda personer.

Genom att designa för ytterligheterna, exempelvis för personer med permanenta nedsättningar, så skapar man ofta även en tillgänglig design för många fler - även för personer utan nedsättning.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    I projektet <a href=\"https://www.funka.com/projekt/myter-om-tillganglighet/\" target=\"_blank\">Myter om tillgänglighet</a> tar sig <a href=\"https://www.funka.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Funka</a> an myten att tillgängliga webbplatser behöver vara svart-vita och tråkiga, och presenterar flera exempel på <a href=\"https://www.funka.com/projekt/myter-om-tillganglighet/kan-tillgangliga-webbplatser-vara-fargglada/\" target=\"_blank\">webbplatser som är såväl tillgängliga som estetiskt tilltalande</a>.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Kort och gott tjänar alla på ökad tillgänglighet!\n  </p>\n\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n\nimport AWiki from '@/components/AWiki.vue'\nimport InfoFields from '@/components/learn/InfoFields.vue'\nimport MediaContainer from '@/components/learn/MediaContainer.vue'\nimport SearchComponent from '@/components/learn/SearchComponent.vue'\nimport SoiGraph from '@/components/SoiGraph.vue'\nimport SlideComponent from '@/components/learn/SlideComponent.vue'\nimport EmbedTwitter from '@/components/embed/EmbedTwitter.vue'\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    AWiki,\n    InfoFields,\n    MediaContainer,\n    SearchComponent,\n    SoiGraph,\n    SlideComponent,\n    EmbedTwitter\n  },\n  data () {\n    return {\n      'header': 'Design och tillgänglighet',\n      badDesign: false,\n      bdClasses: ['bd-justify','bd-nomargin','bd-links','bd-contrast','bd-uppercase'],\n      bdClassActive: 0,\n      clickCounter: 0,\n      showClick: false\n    }\n  },\n  methods: {\n    uglify: function () {\n      if(this.badDesign){\n        this.resetDesign();\n        this.bdClassActive = (this.bdClassActive+1)%this.bdClasses.length;\n      }\n      document.getElementsByTagName(\"BODY\")[0].classList.add(this.bdClasses[this.bdClassActive]);\n      this.badDesign = true;\n    },\n    resetDesign: function () {\n      for(var i = 0; i < this.bdClasses.length; i++){\n        document.getElementsByTagName(\"BODY\")[0].classList.remove(this.bdClasses[i]);\n      }\n      this.badDesign = false;\n    },\n    addClick: function () {\n      this.clickCounter++;\n    },\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<style>\n\n.badInput input:invalid{\n  background: rgb(230,100,100);\n}\n\n.badInput input ~ span{\n  display: none;\n  color: red;\n}\n\n.badInput input:invalid ~ span{\n  display: inline;\n}\n\nbody.bd-serif *{\n  font-family: serif !important;\n}\n\nbody.bd-justify *{\n  text-align: justify;\n  text-align-last: justify;\n}\n\nbody.bd-nomargin *{\n  margin: 0px !important;\n  padding: 0px !important;\n}\n\nbody.bd-minimal *{\n  background: inherit !important;\n  color: black !important;\n  border: 0 !important;\n}\n\nbody.bd-contrast * {\n  color: white !important;\n  background: lightgray !important;\n}\n\nbody.bd-borders *{\n  border: 0 !important;\n  outline: none;\n}\n\nbody.bd-uppercase *{\n  text-transform: uppercase !important;\n}\n\n.bd-links a, .bd-links button{\n  color: inherit !important;\n  font-weight: inherit !important;\n  cursor: text !important;\n  background: inherit !important;\n  border: 0 !important;\n  outline: none !important;\n}\n\n.showClick{\n  cursor: pointer;\n}\n\n.showClick:hover{\n  text-decoration: underline;\n}\n\n</style>\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// src/components/learn/tracks/accessibility/chapters/design.vue","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',[_c('p',[_c('a-wiki',{attrs:{\"c\":\"Design\"}},[_vm._v(\"Design\")]),_vm._v(\" är ett begrepp som innefattar såväl fysiska som digitala objekts funktionalitet och estetik.

Det kan till exempel handla om taligenkänning som kräver att användaren artikulerar klart och tydligt och som därför <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2018/10/voice-assistants-alexa-siri-speech-disabilities-recognition.html\" target=\"_blank\">fungerar dåligt för personer med talsvårigheter</a> eller som <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYvFxs32zvQ\" target=\"_blank\">inte förstår accenter</a> och kraftiga brytningar, eller äldre versioner av <a href=\"https://techworld.idg.se/2.2524/1.709621/recaptcha-v3-google\" target=\"_blank\">reCAPTCHA</a> som kräver att användaren bevisar att hen inte är en bot genom att identifiera svårtolkad text eller bilder - en uppgift som kan upplevas som svår oavsett funktionsförmåga.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      I föregående kapitel nämndes den interaktiva installationen Dansa med synapser som använder en <a-wiki c=\"Kinect\">Kinectkamera</a-wiki> för att beräkna personers position i rummet. För tidiga versioner av Kinect och liknande kameror var användaren tvungen att först posera i givna ställningar och förutsatte att användaren stod upp för att tekniken skulle fungera. Detta innebar som följd att personer i rullstol eller många rörelsehindrade personer ej kunde använda tekniken.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      I mycket av dagens digitala teknik finns olika typer av <a-wiki c=\"Sensor\">sensorer</a-wiki> som mäter olika typer av data, för att exempelvis köra viss programkod eller utföra en uppgift vid särskild <a-wiki c=\"Stimuli\">stimuli</a-wiki>. För designers och utvecklare är det viktigt att veta hur sensorerna fungerar för att säkerställa att produktens eller tjänstens funktion är tillgänglig för samtliga användare. I Twitterinlägget nedan visas en video med en tvålmatare som endast reagerar på ljusa hudtoner, med följd att en mörkhyad person behöver använda en vit pappershandduk för att få maskinen att mata ut tvål. Detta är sannolikt ett omedvetet misstag från företaget som tillverkar tvålmataren, men kan vara ett tecken på bristande mångfald inom företaget: det har uppenbarligen inte resonerats kring eller tagits hänsyn till det faktum att olika personer har olika hudton. Upplevelsen för användaren är katastrofal och situationen kan upplevas som rasistisk.\n    </p>\n\n    <media-container class=\"mediaContainer\">\n      <div>\n        <div class=\"content\">\n          <embed-twitter href=\"https://twitter.com/nke_ise/status/897756900753891328\"></embed-twitter>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"caption\">\n          Den automatiska tvålmataren reagerar inte på mörka hudtoner, och fungerar endast för personer för ljus hy.\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"source\">\n          Källa: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nke_ise/status/897756900753891328\" title=\"@nke_ise (Twitter)\" target=\"_blank\">@nke_ise (Twitter)</a>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </media-container>\n\n    <p>\n      Exemplet ovan är sannolikt en följd av ett felaktigt inställt <a-wiki c=\"Tröskeleffekt\">tröskelvärde</a-wiki> för tvålmatarens <a-wiki c=\"Infraröd_strålning\">IR</a-wiki>-sensor. Problematiken är förhållandevis enkel att såväl synliggöra som för det bakomliggande företaget att åtgärda. Andra program och verktyg, som är utvecklade med <a-wiki c=\"Artificiell_intelligens\">artificiell intelligens</a-wiki> (AI), är desto svårare för en människa att överblicka, och erhållna resultat kan vara svåra att förstå. Istället för att vara explicit programmerade (när tillräckligt mycket ljus reflekteras in i sensorn: mata ut tvål) är en AI programmerad för att ta egna intelligenta beslut utifrån given <a-wiki c=\"Datautvinning\">träningsdata</a-wiki> och ramar. Det innebär mer flexibilitet, men förutsätter också att träningsdatan är av hög kvalitet. Att träna en AI är (extremt förenklat) lite som <a-wiki c=\"Hundträning\">hundträning</a-wiki>: en hund har förutsättningen att lära sig mycket, men det är upp till husse och matte att utföra lämpliga övningar och att följa vissa principer, belöna önskat beteende, och ignorera eller korrigera oönskat beteende.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      I Twitterinlägget nedan visas ett resultat av Google Photos AI, där algoritmerna har tilldelat två personer etiketten <i>Gorillas</i>. Det är, som beskrivet ovan, svårt att förstå de exakta skälen till den felaktiga etiketten, men ifall användaren upplever att den beror på hudfärg eller ansiktsdrag kan tekniken även i detta fall upplevas som rasistisk.\n    </p>\n\n    <media-container class=\"mediaContainer\">\n      <div>\n        <div class=\"content\">\n          <embed-twitter href=\"https://twitter.com/jackyalcine/status/615329515909156865\"></embed-twitter>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"caption\">\n          Google Photos AI har tilldelat två personer etiketten <i>Gorillas</i>.\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"source\">\n          Källa: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jackyalcine/status/615329515909156865\" title=\"@jackyalcine (Twitter)\" target=\"_blank\">@jackyalcine (Twitter)</a>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </media-container>\n\n    <p>\n      Det görs idag mycket forskning kring algoritmer och etik, och kring problematiken med att AI riskerar att spegla våra fördomar och sterotypa föreställningar.

Bland blinda personer anger 9 av 10 att de använder hjälpmedel till sin smarta telefon och nästan var femte att de är i behov av ytterligare hjälpmedel. Mer information om undersökningen och diskussion till begrepp och definitioner finns tillgängligt i projektets <a href=\"http://www.begripsam.se/internet/rapporter/\" target=\"_blank\">rapporter</a>.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      I detta kapitel presenteras grundläggande exempel på digitala hjälpmedel och tekniska lösningar såväl som nya spännande innovationer.\n    </p>\n\n    <h3>Kommunikation och stöd i vardagen</h3>\n\n    <p>\n       En stor och viktig del av vår vardag bygger på mellanmänsklig kommunikation, såväl i fysiska möten som i samtal och text- och bildmeddelanden via mobiltelefon och dator. En utbredd tillgång till internet och god uppkoppling har möjliggjort nya kommunikationslösningar för personer med olika funktionsnedsättningar, såsom videosamtal för att kommunicera med teckenspråk eller läppläsning. <a href=\"https://bildtelefoni.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Bildtelefoni.net</a> är en kostnadsfri tjänst som genom trepartssamtal och -video möjliggör för personer som använder svenskt teckenspråk och personer som använder svenskt tal att ringa till varandra, eller för personer som befinner sig på samma plats att få samtal distanstolkade. <a href=\"https://www.texttelefoni.se/\" target=\"_blank\">Texttelefoni.se</a> erbjuder på liknande sätt stöd för personer med hörselnedsättning, dövhet, dövblindhet, talsvårigheter eller som kommunicerar med text eller punktskrift att ringa samt ta emot samtal.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Nästan <a href=\"https://internet.begripsam.se/#/stats/Dator%2520SMFOI%25202017/1100\" target=\"_blank\">två av tre blinda personer använder punktskriftsdisplayer</a> till sin dator, och surfplattor med <a href=\"https://store.humanware.com/hus/braillenote-touch-32.html\" target=\"_blank\">extern punktskriftdisplay</a> och <a href=\"http://blitab.com/\" target=\"_blank\">taktila skärmar</a> är utvecklade särskilt för denna användargrupp. För personer med <a href=\"https://www.1177.se/Stockholm/Fakta-och-rad/Sjukdomar/ALS\" target=\"_blank\">ALS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.1177.se/Stockholm/Fakta-och-rad/Sjukdomar/Autism/\" target=\"_blank\">autism</a>, <a href=\"https://www.1177.se/Stockholm/Fakta-och-rad/Sjukdomar/Cerebral-pares---CP/\" target=\"_blank\">CP</a> eller Retts syndrom är <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHTlOhDphIc\" target=\"_blank\">Tobiis kommunikationslösningar</a> designade för att styras med exempelvis touch eller ögonrörelser, och erbjuder nya möjligheter att <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVWlNyVby0I\" target=\"_blank\">kommunicera i vardagen</a>.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Annan digital teknik hjälper personer med motorisk nedsatthet eller muskelryckningar att, med <a href=\"http://www.gyenno.com/spoon-en.html\" target=\"_blank\">inbyggd sensorteknik i besticken</a>, stabilisera rörelser då de äter mat.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Enligt designprincipen <a-wiki c=\"Design_för_alla\">Design för alla</a-wiki> bidrar utformning för personer med särskilda behov ofta stora fördelar även för övriga användare. Det är en bra riktlinje och princip att följa, men i de fall det inte är praktiskt möjligt att tillgodose allas behov som standard bör produkten eller tjänsten erbjuda möjligheter för särskild anpassning. Ett exempel är en <a href=\"https://www.dagbladet.no/tema/hemmelig-knapp-gir-mer-tid-over-gangfeltet/62203598\" target=\"_blank\">hemlig knapp för mer tid</a> vid vissa bevakade övergångsställen i Norge.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Utöver kommersiella verktyg och lösningar från kommuner och myndigheter finns det även en betydande <a-wiki c=\"Makerrörelsen\" target=\"_blank\">makerkultur</a-wiki> som designar och utvecklar kraftfulla hjälpmedel. I det Berlinbaserade projektet <a href=\"http://www.madeformywheelchair.de/\" target=\"_blank\">Made for my wheelchair</a> har rullstolsanvändare, designers och ingenjörer samlats för att identifiera behov och utifrån dessa skapa <a-wiki c=\"Gör-det-själv\">Gör-det-själv</a-wiki>-produkter och -tjänster som till en låg kostnad ger stort mervärde till användaren. Resultaten är fritt tillgängliga under öppen licens och är förhållandevis enkla att själv återskapa.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Ett annat exempel på globala, idella krafter är danska <a href=\"https://www.bemyeyes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Be my eyes</a>, en kostnadsfri mobilapp som kopplar samman  blinda och synskadade med seende volontärer för guidning genom vardagssituationer. Genom appen strömmar den synskadade en video av sin omgivning och den situation hen behöver assistans i, t.ex. att läsa skyltar på tågstationen, välja rätt produkt i matbutiken eller hitta örhänget som har tappats på golvet.

Men det är viktigt att även andra områden, såsom möjligheten att ta del av nyheter, samhällsinformation och kulturliv, tillgängligörs för personer med särskilda behov. <a href=\"https://www.mtm.se/\" target=\"_blank\">Myndigheten för tillgängliga medier</a> arbetar för att alla ska ha tillgång till litteratur och samhällsinformation utifrån var och ens egna förutsättningar, oavsett läsförmåga eller funktionsnedsättning, och erbjuder bland annat det digitala bilioteket <a href=\"http://www.legimus.se\" target=\"_blank\">Legimus</a> och nyhetssidan <a href=\"http://8sidor.se/\" target=\"_blank\">8 Sidor</a> med nyheter på lättläst svenska.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      För tillgänglighet inom museisektorn var <a href=\"http://www.funktek.se\" target=\"_blank\">Funktek</a> ett treårigt Göteborgsbaserat projekt som arbetade för allas lika rätt att delta i och skapa kulturen. Med <i>alla</i> museibesökare i åtanke anställdes personer med olika funktionsvariationer, och tillsammans designade projektgruppen olika workshops för att utvärdera tillgängligheten på Göteborgs stadsmuseum. En utgångspunkt var att <i>museet har funktionshinder - inte besökarna</i>.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      När <a href=\"https://www.tekniskamuseet.se\" target=\"_blank\">Tekniska Museet</a> i Stockholm designade och utvecklade utställningen <a href=\"https://www.tekniskamuseet.se/upplev/utstallningar/megamind/\" target=\"_blank\">MegaMind</a> gjordes det med användaren och tillgänglighet i fokus. Utöver att designa för läsbarhet och framkomlighet var det även viktigt att de digitala och interaktiva installationerna inte diskrimerade användaren utifrån exempelvis begränsad tal- eller rörelseförmåga. Installationen Dansa med synapser (utvecklad av <a href=\"https://www.tii.se/projects/dance-with-synapses\" target=\"_blank\">RISE Interactive</a> och Interaktiva rum som driver Mikoteket) använder en <a-wiki c=\"https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect\">Kinectkamera</a-wiki> för att känna av besökarnas positioner och låter dem använda kroppen för att interagera med och styra programmet. Vid den tekniska utvecklingen säkertställdes att tekniken inte förutsatte vissa rörelsemönster och att även rullstulsanvändare kan använda installationen, på lika villkor. En gång i månaden anordnas <a href=\"https://www.tekniskamuseet.se/skolprogram/megamind-funkis-extra-tillgangliga-onsdagar\" target=\"_blank\">MegaMind Funkis</a>, ett tillfälle för skolgrupper med olika funktionsvariationer att besöka museet i lugn och ro.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      På <a href=\"https://www.akvarellmuseet.org\" target=\"_blank\">Nordiska Akvarellmuseet</a> på Tjörn drivs projektet <a href=\"https://www.akvarellmuseet.org/projekt/distansbesok-pa-konstmuseum\" target=\"_blank\">Distansbesök på konstmuseum</a> tillsammans med <a href=\"https://www.tii.se/projects/en-robot-besoker-museum\" target=\"_blank\">RISE Interactive</a>, med syfte att ge personer som har svårt att fysiskt besöka museet en chans till ett möte och museivisning i realtid. Distansvisning med hjälp av en robot, till skillnad från exempelvis inspelad visning, möjliggör aktivt deltagande och samtal, och strävar att efterlikna en visning på plats. Rummet tas in, konstpedagog och deltagare kan se varandra via skärmen och ställa frågor, flika in och samtala kring konsten man gemensamt ser.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      På National Theatre i Storbrittanien erbjuds för vissa föreställningar <a-wiki c=\"Förstärkt_verklighet\">AR</a-wiki>-glasögon för att ge automatiskt synkroniserade <a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/your-visit/access/caption-glasses\" target=\"_blank\">undertexter till personer som är döva eller med nedsatt hörsel</a>. Detta möjliggör för åskådaren att bättre följa skådespelarna på scen, se deras ansiktsuttryck och läsa deras läppar, och bidrar sammantaget till en starkare teaterupplevelse. Även användningen av ljud kan förstärka kulturupplevelser för döva personer. På biografer är användningen av lågfrekventa ljud, som känns i kroppen som vibrationer, ett effektivt sätt att skapa extra känsla i filmer. Framförallt action- och skräckgenren är idag duktiga på att uttnyttja detta, men även inom andra genrer kan tekniken användas för att <a href=\"https://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/nytt-filmljud-far-horselskadade-att-kanna-skracken/\" target=\"_blank\">förhöja upplevelsen för döva och hörselskadade</a>.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Inom datorspelkulturen krävs ofta snabba reflexer och fullt fungerande motorik för att praktiskt kunna delta. Användaren behöver simultant kunna styra mus och tangentbord eller använda en handhållen spelkontroll med joystick och många små knappar. För personer med motoriska funktionshinder är dessa kontroller i många fall omöjliga att använda. Microsoft har uvecklat\n      <a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/controllers/xbox-adaptive-controller\" target=\"_blank\">Xbox Adaptive Controller</a>, en spelkontroll med stora fysiska knappar och stora anpassningmöjligheter för styrning med såväl händer, fötter, axlar eller andra kroppsdelar.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n\n      <a-wiki c=\"Förstapersonsskjutare\">FPS</a-wiki>-spelaren <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMvikz2cA-8\" target=\"_blank\">RockyNoHands</a> använder en <a href=\"https://www.quadstick.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Quadstick</a> med munjoystick och sensorer för sug- och utblås, en spelstyrenhet utvecklad för personer med <a-wiki c=\"Tetraplegi\">tetraplegi</a-wiki>, nedsatt eller förlorad sensorisk eller motorisk funktion som följd av ryggmärgsskada.
