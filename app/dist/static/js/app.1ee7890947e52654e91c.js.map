Även här spelar en mängd faktorer roll, inte minst din geografiska position - något som du säkert noterade i sökresultaten ovan då du föreslogs lokala fiskrestauranger. Att avgöra din geografiska position är förhållandevis enkelt, förutsatt att hårdvaran stödjer det och att du först tillåter webbplatsen att läsa dina koordinater.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<location-component></location-component>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t Många sökmotorer sparar även information om dina surfvanor för att ytterligare skräddarsy sökresultaten. Ifall du är idrotts- eller modeintresse så speglas detta sannolikt i dina sökningar och i de webbplatser du besöker. Detta noteras och registreras av sökmotorerna som hittar mönster och skapar sig en förståelse för vem du är. När du vid senare tillfälle söker på en geografisk ort, e.g. Göteborg, så kan denna information användas för att, exempelvis, ge personligt riktad information om idrottsevenemang eller klädbutiker på denna ort.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t De resultat som <i>du</i> ser vid en sökning kan skilja sig avsevärt från en annan persons resultat, trots att ni har sökt på exakt samma term.

Hårdvara som datorer, telefoner och smarta-hem-lösningar, och mjukvarutjänster såsom sökmotorer, sociala plattformar, chatappar och streamingtjänster är bara ett litet urval. Vad man kanske inte alltid tänker på, eller är medveten om, är att många av de populära produkter och tjänster som vi använder dagligen ofta ägs av ett fåtal stora IT-jättar - företag som tjänar enorma pengar på sina användare.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tBland de <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_Internet_companies\" title=\"Wikipedia: List of largest Internet companies\n\" target=\"_blank\">stora internetföretagen</a> ser vi att det är amerikanska och kinesiska företag som toppar listan över högst omsättning, främst inom marknader som onlinehandel, webbsök och sociala plattformar.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tOavsett marknad så är dessa företag experter på att lära känna dig som användare. En del information har du säkert angett själv, och den data som saknas kommer istället att beräknas: sökmotorer analyserar dina sökmönster; webbläsare loggar de sidor du besöker; onlinebutiker registrerar vilka produkter du är intresserad av; och de sociala plattformarna räknar ut dina intressen, dina politiska åsikter och vilka nyheter du och dina vänner gillar, baserat på vad ni skriver, gillar, klickar på och delar vidare.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFör många internettjänster har du möjligheten att skapa personliga konton som du använder kostnadsfritt på dina olika enheter. Det kan exempelvis vara väldigt smidigt att, med ett och samma Google-konto, vara inloggad på såväl dator som telefon och låta inställningar, bokmärken, kontakter och kalendrar sparas och synkroniseras automatiskt. Utöver att vara ett köpargument för ett företags produkter och tjänster så innebär det ytterligare möjligheter till insamling av personlig data.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tInformationen om dig är mycket värdefull och används till stor del för att skräddarsy vad som presenteras för dig på internet - även utanför internettjänstens egen webbplats. Annonser i sökmotorer och andra webbplatser, artiklar på sociala plattformar och nyhetssidor, samt andra personliga rekommendationer baseras till stor del på dina egna <a href=\"https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektroniskt_fotsp%C3%A5r\" title=\"Wikipedia: Elektroniskt fotspår\" target=\"_blank\">digitala fotspår</a> och är alla potentiella intäkter för företaget.

Böcker kunde tryckas i större upplagor för ökad spridning, vilket innebar större möjlighet att nå ut med information och läror. Även om de tidiga publikationerna ofta var av religös litteratur, e.g. <a-wiki c=\"Gutenbergs_Bibel\">Gutenbergs bibel</a-wiki>, så innebar utvecklingen under renässansen att fler gavs möjlighet att sprida idéer som kunde utmana politiska och religösa auktoriteter.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Under 1800-talets andra hälft <a-wiki c=\"Svenska_dagstidningar\">grundades flera dagstidningar</a-wiki> som riktade sig till en bred publik till ett lågt pris. Detta var till följd av den tekniska utvecklingen inom papper och tryckpressar som gjorde tidningarna billigare att trycka, och innebar att en större del av befolkningen fick tillgång till viktig samhällsinformation.

Vice versa ska objektet vara designat så att den avsedda och förväntade funktionaliteten möjliggörs.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n     Vidare bör all design utgå från den tänkta användaren och dennes behov. Hänsyn ska tas till användarens förkunskaper, förutsättningar och begränsingar, den tid och situation då objektet är tänkt att användas, samt övrigt som påverkar hur objektet eller användandet av detsamma upplevs av den tilltänkte användaren.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Många av våra vardagliga föremål har en väl genomarbetad design som vi ofta tar för given och inte funderar särskilt mycket kring. För att synliggöra designen i vardagsföremål skapar konstnären Katerina Kamprani i projektet <a href=\"https://www.theuncomfortable.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Uncomfortable</a> objekt i vilka den obekväma designen motverkar, snarare än stödjer, den funktionalitet användaren förväntar sig eller är van vid.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Bra design ska vara tillgänglig för alla. Även om våra vardagliga föremål ofta har en genomtänkt design kan de i många fall vara svåra eller rentav farliga att använda för personer med olika funktionsnedsättningar.

På <a href=\"https://webbriktlinjer.se/\" target=\"_blank\">Webbriktlinjer.se</a> anges de officiella riktlinjerna för hur svensk offentlig sektor bör arbeta med webbplatser, samt <a href=\"https://webbriktlinjer.se/lagkrav/webbdirektivet/\" target=\"_blank\">EU:s webbdirektiv</a> som är lag från 2019. I avdelningen <a href=\"https://webbriktlinjer.se/webbforalla/\" target=\"_blank\">Webb för alla</a> presenteras särskilt information om webbutveckling ur ett tillgänglighetsperspektiv.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Även om riktlinjerna är framtagna för verktyg och tjänster på webben är de i många fall applicerbara även på andra skärmbaserade verktyg, såsom mobilappar, spel, etc. En grundprincip är att användarens kognitiva belastning ska minimeras. Information ska vara enkel att hitta och användaren ska känna att hen är i kontroll.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Nedan följer ett par grundläggande designprinciper härledda från webbriktlinjerna:\n    <ul class=\"nested\">\n      <li>\n        Information ska vara tydligt strukturerad.\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            Det ska vara enkelt att skilja på webbplatsens olika delar.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Information ska presenteras i en logisk och konsekvent följd.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Alternativa texter ska finnas för bilder, videor, länkar, etc.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Överflödig information och intryck ska undvikas.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Textavsnitt ska vara läsbara.\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            Typsnitt ska vara tydliga och i lagom textstorlek.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Språket ska vara anpassat till användaren.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Färger ska användas genomtänkt och ge bra kontraster.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Designa för mobila och små skärmar\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n              Layouten ska anpassas automatiskt till olika skärmstorlekar.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Knappar och andra interaktiva element ska ha tillräckligt stor klick- och touchyta.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Interaktiva element ska inte ligga för tätt.\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Synliggör funktionaliteten.\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            <a>Länkar</a>, <button>knappar</button>, etc. ska vara tydligt markerade.\n          </li>\n\n          <li>\n            Effekten av en interaktion ska vara tydlig, användaren ska inte behöva gissa eller testa vad som kommer att hända.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Ge återkoppling vid interaktion.\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            Effekten av en interaktion ska ske <i>när</i> och <i>där</i> användaren interagerar, inte med fördröjning eller på någon annan del av skärmen.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Vid behov, visa vad som pågår, exempelvis vid laddning av data.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Undvik möjligheten för användaren att göra fel eller ge tydliga felmeddelanden.\n          </li>\n\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Navigation\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            Det ska gå att navigera med tangentbordet, och se vad som är markerat.

För designers och utvecklare är det viktigt att veta hur sensorerna fungerar för att säkerställa att produktens eller tjänstens funktion är tillgänglig för samtliga användare. I Twitterinlägget nedan visas en video med en tvålmatare som endast reagerar på ljusa hudtoner, med följd att en mörkhyad person behöver använda en vit pappershandduk för att få maskinen att mata ut tvål. Detta är sannolikt ett omedvetet misstag från företaget som tillverkar tvålmataren, men kan vara ett tecken på bristande mångfald inom företaget: det har uppenbarligen inte resonerats kring eller tagits hänsyn till det faktum att olika personer har olika hudton.

Istället för att vara explicit programmerade (när tillräckligt mycket ljus reflekteras in i sensorn: mata ut tvål) är en AI programmerad för att ta egna intelligenta beslut utifrån given <a-wiki c=\"Datautvinning\">träningsdata</a-wiki> och ramar. Det innebär mer flexibilitet, men förutsätter också att träningsdatan är av hög kvalitet. Att träna en AI är (extremt förenklat) lite som <a-wiki c=\"Hundträning\">hundträning</a-wiki>: en hund har förutsättningen att lära sig mycket, men det är upp till husse och matte att utföra lämpliga övningar och att följa vissa principer, belöna önskat beteende, och ignorera eller korrigera oönskat beteende.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      I Twitterinlägget nedan visas ett resultat av Google Photos AI, där algoritmerna har tilldelat två personer etiketten <i>Gorillas</i>.

En utbredd tillgång till internet och god uppkoppling har möjliggjort nya kommunikationslösningar för personer med olika funktionsnedsättningar, såsom videosamtal för att kommunicera med teckenspråk eller läppläsning. <a href=\"https://bildtelefoni.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Bildtelefoni.net</a> är en kostnadsfri tjänst som genom trepartssamtal och -video möjliggör för personer som använder svenskt teckenspråk och personer som använder svenskt tal att ringa till varandra, eller för personer som befinner sig på samma plats att få samtal distanstolkade. <a href=\"https://www.texttelefoni.se/\" target=\"_blank\">Texttelefoni.se</a> erbjuder på liknande sätt stöd för personer med hörselnedsättning, dövhet, dövblindhet, talsvårigheter eller som kommunicerar med text eller punktskrift att ringa samt ta emot samtal.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Nästan <a href=\"https://internet.begripsam.se/#/stats/Dator%2520SMFOI%25202017/1100\" target=\"_blank\">två av tre blinda personer använder punktskriftsdisplayer</a> till sin dator, och surfplattor med <a href=\"https://store.humanware.com/hus/braillenote-touch-32.html\" target=\"_blank\">extern punktskriftdisplay</a> och <a href=\"http://blitab.com/\" target=\"_blank\">taktila skärmar</a> är utvecklade särskilt för denna användargrupp. För personer med <a href=\"https://www.1177.se/Stockholm/Fakta-och-rad/Sjukdomar/ALS\" target=\"_blank\">ALS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.1177.se/Stockholm/Fakta-och-rad/Sjukdomar/Autism/\" target=\"_blank\">autism</a>, <a href=\"https://www.1177.se/Stockholm/Fakta-och-rad/Sjukdomar/Cerebral-pares---CP/\" target=\"_blank\">CP</a> eller Retts syndrom är <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHTlOhDphIc\" target=\"_blank\">Tobiis kommunikationslösningar</a> designade för att styras med exempelvis touch eller ögonrörelser, och erbjuder nya möjligheter att <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVWlNyVby0I\" target=\"_blank\">kommunicera i vardagen</a>.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Annan digital teknik hjälper personer med motorisk nedsatthet eller muskelryckningar att, med <a href=\"http://www.gyenno.com/spoon-en.html\" target=\"_blank\">inbyggd sensorteknik i besticken</a>, stabilisera rörelser då de äter mat.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Enligt designprincipen <a-wiki c=\"Design_för_alla\">Design för alla</a-wiki> bidrar utformning för personer med särskilda behov ofta stora fördelar även för övriga användare. Det är en bra riktlinje och princip att följa, men i de fall det inte är praktiskt möjligt att tillgodose allas behov som standard bör produkten eller tjänsten erbjuda möjligheter för särskild anpassning. Ett exempel är en <a href=\"https://www.dagbladet.no/tema/hemmelig-knapp-gir-mer-tid-over-gangfeltet/62203598\" target=\"_blank\">hemlig knapp för mer tid</a> vid vissa bevakade övergångsställen i Norge.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Utöver kommersiella verktyg och lösningar från kommuner och myndigheter finns det även en betydande <a-wiki c=\"Makerrörelsen\" target=\"_blank\">makerkultur</a-wiki> som designar och utvecklar kraftfulla hjälpmedel. I det Berlinbaserade projektet <a href=\"http://www.madeformywheelchair.de/\" target=\"_blank\">Made for my wheelchair</a> har rullstolsanvändare, designers och ingenjörer samlats för att identifiera behov och utifrån dessa skapa <a-wiki c=\"Gör-det-själv\">Gör-det-själv</a-wiki>-produkter och -tjänster som till en låg kostnad ger stort mervärde till användaren. Resultaten är fritt tillgängliga under öppen licens och är förhållandevis enkla att själv återskapa.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Ett annat exempel på globala, idella krafter är danska <a href=\"https://www.bemyeyes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Be my eyes</a>, en kostnadsfri mobilapp som kopplar samman  blinda och synskadade med seende volontärer för guidning genom vardagssituationer. Genom appen strömmar den synskadade en video av sin omgivning och den situation hen behöver assistans i, t.ex. att läsa skyltar på tågstationen, välja rätt produkt i matbutiken eller hitta örhänget som har tappats på golvet. Den seende personen, som ser videon direkt i sin egen telefon, beskriver vad som filmas och fungerar i praktiken som ett par virtuella ögon åt den synskadade.\n    </p>\n\n    <media-container class=\"mediaContainer\">\n      <div>\n        <div class=\"content\">\n          <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6GRfFuWsjNU\" width=\"100%\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"caption\">\n          Be My Eyes kopplar samman blinda och synskadade med videoströmning, för assistans i vardagen.\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"source\">\n          Källa: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GRfFuWsjNU\" title=\"Youtube: Be My Eyes - Bringing Sight to Blind and Low Vision People\" target=\"_blank\">Be My Eyes (Youtube)</a>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </media-container>\n\n    <info-fields class=\"infoFields\" id=\"hur-kommunicerar-du\">\n\n      <div class=\"excercise\">\n\n        <div class=\"hBox\">\n          Hur kommunicerar du?\n        </div>\n\n        <p>\n          Reflektera över de verktyg och tjänster du använder för att kommunicera i vardagen.\n        </p>\n\n        <div class=\"hBox\">\n          DISKUTERA\n        </div>\n\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            Vilka verktyg och tjänster använder du för att kommunicera med familj, vänner, företag och myndigheter?\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Hur använder du dessa verktyg och tjänster?\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Vilka personer kan ha svårt att använda dessa verktyg och tjänster?\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Hur kan verktygen och tjänsterna hjälpa personer med olika funktionsnedsättningar att kommunicera?\n          </li>\n\n        </ul>\n\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"excercise\" id=\"var-nagons-ogon\">\n\n        <div class=\"hBox\">\n          Var någons ögon\n        </div>\n\n        <p>\n          Tillsammans med en vän, använd videosamtal för att guida varandra genom rummet.\n        </p>\n\n        <ol>\n          <li>\n            Person A laddar hem appen <span class=\"semibold\">Jitsi Meet</span> till sin mobil eller surfplatta, och går in i rummet: <random-string v-model=\"jitsi\" class=\"semibold\"></random-string>.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Person B gör detsamma <i>eller</i> går in på webbplatsen <a :href=\"'https://meet.jit.si/'+jitsi\" target=\"_blank\">https://meet.jit.si/{{jitsi}}</a> på sin dator.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Kontrollera att båda kan se och höra varandra i videosamtalet.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Person A blundar och filmar omgivningen med sin mobiltelefon.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Person B beskriver vad hen ser och ger instruktioner och enkla uppgifter för Person A att utföra.\n          </li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <p>\n          Obs!

Men det är viktigt att även andra områden, såsom möjligheten att ta del av nyheter, samhällsinformation och kulturliv, tillgängligörs för personer med särskilda behov. <a href=\"https://www.mtm.se/\" target=\"_blank\">Myndigheten för tillgängliga medier</a> arbetar för att alla ska ha tillgång till litteratur och samhällsinformation utifrån var och ens egna förutsättningar, oavsett läsförmåga eller funktionsnedsättning, och erbjuder bland annat det digitala bilioteket <a href=\"http://www.legimus.se\" target=\"_blank\">Legimus</a> och nyhetssidan <a href=\"http://8sidor.se/\" target=\"_blank\">8 Sidor</a> med nyheter på lättläst svenska.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      För tillgänglighet inom museisektorn var <a href=\"http://www.funktek.se\" target=\"_blank\">Funktek</a> ett treårigt Göteborgsbaserat projekt som arbetade för allas lika rätt att delta i och skapa kulturen. Med <i>alla</i> museibesökare i åtanke anställdes personer med olika funktionsvariationer, och tillsammans designade projektgruppen olika workshops för att utvärdera tillgängligheten på Göteborgs stadsmuseum. En utgångspunkt var att <i>museet har funktionshinder - inte besökarna</i>.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      När <a href=\"https://www.tekniskamuseet.se\" target=\"_blank\">Tekniska Museet</a> i Stockholm designade och utvecklade utställningen <a href=\"https://www.tekniskamuseet.se/upplev/utstallningar/megamind/\" target=\"_blank\">MegaMind</a> gjordes det med användaren och tillgänglighet i fokus. Utöver att designa för läsbarhet och framkomlighet var det även viktigt att de digitala och interaktiva installationerna inte diskrimerade användaren utifrån exempelvis begränsad tal- eller rörelseförmåga. Installationen Dansa med synapser (utvecklad av <a href=\"https://www.tii.se/projects/dance-with-synapses\" target=\"_blank\">RISE Interactive</a> och Interaktiva rum som driver Mikoteket) använder en <a-wiki c=\"https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect\">Kinectkamera</a-wiki> för att känna av besökarnas positioner och låter dem använda kroppen för att interagera med och styra programmet. Vid den tekniska utvecklingen säkertställdes att tekniken inte förutsatte vissa rörelsemönster och att även rullstulsanvändare kan använda installationen, på lika villkor. En gång i månaden anordnas <a href=\"https://www.tekniskamuseet.se/skolprogram/megamind-funkis-extra-tillgangliga-onsdagar\" target=\"_blank\">MegaMind Funkis</a>, ett tillfälle för skolgrupper med olika funktionsvariationer att besöka museet i lugn och ro.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      På <a href=\"https://www.akvarellmuseet.org\" target=\"_blank\">Nordiska Akvarellmuseet</a> på Tjörn drivs projektet <a href=\"https://www.akvarellmuseet.org/projekt/distansbesok-pa-konstmuseum\" target=\"_blank\">Distansbesök på konstmuseum</a> tillsammans med <a href=\"https://www.tii.se/projects/en-robot-besoker-museum\" target=\"_blank\">RISE Interactive</a>, med syfte att ge personer som har svårt att fysiskt besöka museet en chans till ett möte och museivisning i realtid. Distansvisning med hjälp av en robot, till skillnad från exempelvis inspelad visning, möjliggör aktivt deltagande och samtal, och strävar att efterlikna en visning på plats. Rummet tas in, konstpedagog och deltagare kan se varandra via skärmen och ställa frågor, flika in och samtala kring konsten man gemensamt ser.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      På National Theatre i Storbrittanien erbjuds för vissa föreställningar <a-wiki c=\"Förstärkt_verklighet\">AR</a-wiki>-glasögon för att ge automatiskt synkroniserade <a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/your-visit/access/caption-glasses\" target=\"_blank\">undertexter till personer som är döva eller med nedsatt hörsel</a>. Detta möjliggör för åskådaren att bättre följa skådespelarna på scen, se deras ansiktsuttryck och läsa deras läppar, och bidrar sammantaget till en starkare teaterupplevelse. Även användningen av ljud kan förstärka kulturupplevelser för döva personer. På biografer är användningen av lågfrekventa ljud, som känns i kroppen som vibrationer, ett effektivt sätt att skapa extra känsla i filmer. Framförallt action- och skräckgenren är idag duktiga på att uttnyttja detta, men även inom andra genrer kan tekniken användas för att <a href=\"https://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/nytt-filmljud-far-horselskadade-att-kanna-skracken/\" target=\"_blank\">förhöja upplevelsen för döva och hörselskadade</a>.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Inom datorspelkulturen krävs ofta snabba reflexer och fullt fungerande motorik för att praktiskt kunna delta. Användaren behöver simultant kunna styra mus och tangentbord eller använda en handhållen spelkontroll med joystick och många små knappar. För personer med motoriska funktionshinder är dessa kontroller i många fall omöjliga att använda. Microsoft har uvecklat\n      <a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/controllers/xbox-adaptive-controller\" target=\"_blank\">Xbox Adaptive Controller</a>, en spelkontroll med stora fysiska knappar och stora anpassningmöjligheter för styrning med såväl händer, fötter, axlar eller andra kroppsdelar.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n\n      <a-wiki c=\"Förstapersonsskjutare\">FPS</a-wiki>-spelaren <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMvikz2cA-8\" target=\"_blank\">RockyNoHands</a> använder en <a href=\"https://www.quadstick.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Quadstick</a> med munjoystick och sensorer för sug- och utblås, en spelstyrenhet utvecklad för personer med <a-wiki c=\"Tetraplegi\">tetraplegi</a-wiki>, nedsatt eller förlorad sensorisk eller motorisk funktion som följd av ryggmärgsskada.
